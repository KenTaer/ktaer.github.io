                <h1>Overview of the Practicum Engagement</h1>
                <div class="prac-content">
                    <p class="prac-desc">Before I start doing the Practicum engagement, I was first required to choose from three options that were recommended to me on how I would prefer to take on the Practicum. The first path is the HTE, which would require me to fill in a form that would serve as my preferred company which I would like to work with, then the form would be processed by our dean and would try to endorse my letter to the company that I have selected. Next is the Learning Path, wherein it is mandatory to enroll for a premium LinkedIn Learning account before I could access the learning modules that I have proposed and accepted by our dean. Lastly, is the combination of Learning Path and Project-based practicum which would be given by the Mapúa Malayan Colleges Laguna.</br></br></p>
                    <p class="prac-desc">As for the path that I have chosen, I selected the Learning Path on which I am required to create a LinkedIn Learning account and construct a learning path proposal that would consist of two modules: (1) Required module that was given to us by default and (2) Specialization module which I was tasked to look for two module topics that I would like to pursue and study in LinkedIn Learning, in my case I chose the Web Development and User Experience related-modules. Each module that I have accomplished would give me a certificate that would act as a proof of completion.</br></br></p>
                    <p class="prac-desc">To complete the needed hours of practicum, I must conduct a total of 486 hours of studying of modules in LinkedIn Learning. There is also an instruction as for the engagement hours in LinkedIn Learning would be multiplied into two (Total Hours Engagement * 2 = Total Hours Credited).</p>

                    <p class="prac-desc">In the LinkedIn Learning, for each set of modules, there are short pop-up quiz in a multiple choice that needs to be answered as a way to assess my understanding based on the topic of the module, some questions has the feature to try multiple attempts when failing to select the correct answer, and the failed question of the quiz itself will provide a recommended video that I could watch to review the question and answer it again. In addition to that, every module will provide some files that I could download and extract that would serves as my exercise while following the instructions in the video. There is no submission bin for the exercise, it only serves as an exercise material that I could use during the video discussion.</p>

                    <p class="prac-desc">As what is shown in the checklist above, the practicum learning path is divided into two parts, the required module that was recommended to me by the Mapúa Malayan Colleges Laguna and the specialization module that I personally selected on what set of modules that I am planning to study and look for in the LinkedIn Learning. The required module is composed of three learning modules, namely called Design Thinking, Project Management, and Workplace Management. While, on the other hand, the specialization module mainly consists of Web Development and User Experience modules.</br></br></p>
                    <p class="prac-desc">Here is an overview on what I learned during the time that I was studying the Required Learning Modules. First, is the Design Thinking which gives me an understanding that I should always practice being creative to help improve my innovation skill and help me face on challenges that are unpredictable. Moreover, being a person that has a decisive mindset can develop critical thinking and problem-solving skills. Next is the Project Management, that provides education on how to be a great follower as a way of communication and improve relationships with the co-workers, while also having the characteristics of being a leader for the right moments. Lastly is the Workplace Management that shares the proper manner for business by providing the appropriate gestures and way of socialization in the industry. It also discusses the importance of managing time when by allocating it accordingly based on what schedule is the most productive and for resting.</br></br></p>

                    <p class="prac-desc">During my time on the practicum engagement, the LinkedIn Learning helped me gave an idea on what I should expect on the workplace, specifically, the traits and manners that I must have in order to be a successful individual and compete in high-level with different people that follows the same career path that I have chosen. These are the following things that I considered valuable to be an accomplished employee that I manage to acquire from the modules, first is the ability to think creatively when encountering obstacles in the workspace, since it allows one to think outside the box and have a different approach when getting to the bottom of the dilemma, which also translates to improving critical-thinking and problem-solving skills.</br></br></p>
                    <p class="prac-desc">As for the skills that I must have to be a future web developer, I still have lots of things to learn, since the knowledge that I acquire from the practicum engagement is only the tip of the iceberg yet a considerably good start to have a general idea on what I should anticipate becoming a front-end, back-end, or full-stack developer. It will require time, effort, and experience to understand and master the most essential parts of creating a website, which are the HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Database.</br></br></p>
                    <p class="prac-desc">All in all, the modules that I watched and studied in the LinkedIn Learning will be extremely beneficial for me, not only to become an excellent web developer but as a future professional in general, that has the appropriate skill sets to develop and solve things efficiently and has the suitable manner inside and outside of the workplace.</br></br></p>
